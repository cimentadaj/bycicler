# Bycicler

A dockerized scraper of bicycle station status for Barcelona. This is a more mature spinoff of my original [bicing expirement](https://github.com/cimentadaj/bicing_experiment/) using Airflow for automatic scheduling and a Dockerized framework for increasing modularity.

For some background on how Airflow works in this dockerized version see [here](https://cimentadaj.github.io/blog/2020-12-07-lightweight-airflow-deployment-with-docker/lightweight-airflow-deployment-with-docker/). For further background on how the scraper actually speaks to the MySQL database see [here](https://cimentadaj.github.io/blog/2020-11-25-deploying-mysql-database-using-docker/deploying-mysql-database-using-docker/) and [here](https://cimentadaj.github.io/blog/2021-01-11-talking-between-containers-in-dockercompose/talking-between-containers-in-docker-compose/)

This is a work in progress.
